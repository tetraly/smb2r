This is the home of the Super Mario Brothers 2 (US) Randomizer

For now, this repository will only be used for distributing the latest stable(ish) release, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/tetraly/smb2r/releases
The source code is in development on a separate private repository and will be moved here once ready for a wider release.

If you'd like to learn more or get involved with the development, please ask on the SMB2R Discord (https://discord.gg/gNXANyV).
